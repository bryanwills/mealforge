# MealForge Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic recipe management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ User authentication with Clerk
- ✅ Recipe import from URL (basic implementation)

## URL Import Accuracy Improvements

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Low Accuracy (~15%)**: Current import shows poor ingredient parsing and incorrect instructions
2. **Title Extraction**: Not properly extracting "Butterfinger Bars" from URL path
3. **Ingredient Parsing**: All ingredients showing as "1 piece" instead of proper quantities
4. **Instruction Accuracy**: Completely wrong instructions being imported
5. **Image Import**: No images being extracted from recipe pages
6. **URL Handling**: No referral link removal or URL cleaning

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### ✅ Step 1: Fixed Tailwind Configuration
- Updated `tailwind.config.js` with proper shadcn/ui configuration
- Installed `tailwindcss-animate` plugin

```typescript
interface PrintURLPatterns {
  pattern: RegExp
  replacement: string
  priority: number
}

const PRINT_URL_PATTERNS: PrintURLPatterns[] = [
  {
    pattern: /^https:\/\/[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)$/,
    replacement: 'https://$1/wprm_print/$2',
    priority: 1
  },
  {
    pattern: /^https:\/\/[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/([^\/]+)$/,
    replacement: 'https://$1/print/$2',
    priority: 2
  },
  {
    pattern: /^https:\/\/[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/([^\/]+)$/,
    replacement: 'https://$1/print-recipe/$2',
    priority: 3
  }
]
```
